<details>
<summary>
What is DevOps?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Amazon:</p>
<p>“DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.”</p>
<p>Microsoft:</p>
<p>“DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users. The contraction of “Dev” and “Ops” refers to replacing siloed Development and Operations to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications."</p>
<p>Red Hat:</p>
<p>“DevOps describes approaches to speeding up the processes by which an idea (like a new software feature, a request for enhancement, or a bug fix) goes from development to deployment in a production environment where it can provide value to the user. These approaches require that development teams and operations teams communicate frequently and approach their work with empathy for their teammates. Scalability and flexible provisioning are also necessary. With DevOps, those that need power the most, get it—through self service and automation. Developers, usually coding in a standard development environment, work closely with IT operations to speed software builds, tests, and releases—without sacrificing reliability.”</p>
</b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What are the benefits of DevOps? What it can help us to achieve?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>You should mention some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Improved delivery</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Scale</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
</ul>
Make sure to elaborate :) </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What are the anti-patterns of DevOps?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Not allowing to push in production on Friday :)</li>
<li>One specific person is in charge of different tasks. For example there is only one person who is allowed to merge the code of everyone else</li>
<li>Treating production differently from development environment. For example, not implementing security in development environment </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What is Continuous Integration?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. It can range from a couple of changes every day or a week to a couple of changes in one hour in larger scales.</p>
Each piece of code (change/patch) is verified, to make the change is safe to merge. Today, it’s a common practice to test the change using an automated build that makes sure the code can integrated. It can be one build which runs several tests in different levels (unit, functional, etc.) or several separate builds that all or some has to pass in order for the change to be merged into the repository. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is Continuous Deployment?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A development strategy used by developers to release software automatically into production where any code commit must pass through an automated testing phase. Only when this is successful is the release considered production worthy. This eliminates any human interaction and should be implemented only after production-ready pipelines have been set with real-time monitoring and reporting of deployed assets. If any issues are detected in production it should be easy to rollback to previous working state.</p>

</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is Continuous Delivery?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A development strategy used to frequently deliver code to QA and Ops for testing. This entails having a staging area that has production like features where changes can only be accepted for production after a manual review. Because of this human entanglement there is usually a time lag between release and review making it slower and error prone as compared to continous deployment.</p>

<li>Code coverage - Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo</li>
<li>Tests - Robot, Serenity, Gauge </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What are you taking into consideration when choosing a tool/technology?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
In your answer you can mention one or more of the following: * mature vs. cutting edge * community size * architecture aspects - agent vs. agentless, master vs. masterless, etc. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Explain mutable vs. immutable infrastructure
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>In mutable infrastructure paradigm, changes are applied on top of the existing infrastructure and over time the infrastructure builds up a history of changes. Ansible, Puppet and Chef are examples of tools which follow mutable infrastructure paradigm.</p>
In immutable infrastructure paradigm, every change is actually a new infrastructure. So a change to a server will result in a new server instead of updating it. Terraform is an example of technology which follows the immutable infrastructure paradigm. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What ways are you familiar with to deliver a software? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Archive - collect all your app files into one archive (e.g. tar) and deliver it to the user.</li>
<li>Package - depends on the OS, you can use your OS package format (e.g. in RHEL/Fefodra it’s RPM) to deliver your software with a way to install, uninstall and update it using the standard packager commands</li>
<li>Images - Either VM or container images where your package is included with everything it needs in order to run successfully. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What is caching? How does it works? Why is it important?
</summary>
<br><b> Caching is fast access to frequently used resources which are computationally expensive or IO intensive and do not change often. There can be several layers of cache that can start from CPU caches to distributed cache systems. Common ones are in memory caching and distributed caching. <br/> Caches are typically data structures that contains some data, such as a hashtable or dictionary. However, any data structure can provide caching capabilities, like set, sorted set, sorted dictionary etc. While, caching is used in many applications, they can create subtle bugs if not implemented correctly or used correctly. For example,cache invalidation, expiration or updating is usually quite challenging and hard. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Explain stateless vs. stateful
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Stateless applications don’t store any data in the host which makes it ideal for horizontal scaling and microservices. Stateful applications depend on the storage to save state and data, typically databases are stateful applications. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Describe the workflow of setting up some type of web server (Apache, IIS, Tomcat, …)

<summary>
You need to install periodically the same package on different operating systems (Ubuntu, RHEL, …). How would you do it?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
It can be as simple as one Ansible (or other CM tool) task that runs periodically with Cron. In more advanced cases, perhaps a CI system. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is Reliability? How does it fit DevOps?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Reliability, when used in DevOps context, is the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure failure or disruption. Part of it is also being able to scale based on your organization or team demands. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Compare SRE to DevOps
</summary>
<br><b> </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What SRE team is responsible for?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
One can argue whether it’s per company definition or a global one but at least according to a large companies, like Google for example, the SRE team is responsible for availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of their services </b>

What is an error budget?
</summary>
<br><b> </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What are MTTF (mean time to failure) and MTTR (mean time to repair)? What these metrics help us to evaluate?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<pre><code>* MTTF (mean time to failure) other known as uptime, can be defined as how long the system run before if fails.
* MTTR (mean time to recover) on the other hand, is the amount of time it takes to repair a system.
* MTBF (mean time between failues) is the amount of time between failures of the system. These errors can be intermittent or fatal.</code></pre>

<br><b> IAC (infrastructure as code) is a declerative approach of defining infrastructure or architecture of a system. Some implementations are ARM templates for Azure and Terraform that can work across multiple cloud providers. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How do you manage build artifacts?
</summary>
<br><b> Build artifacts are usually stored in a repository. They can be used in release pipelines for deployment purposes. Usually there is retention period on the build artifacts. </b>

What is a configuration drift? What problems is it causing?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Configuration drift happens when in an environment of servers with the exact same configuration and software, a certain server or servers are being applied with updates or configuration which other servers don’t get and over time these servers become slightly different than all others.</p>
This situation might lead to bugs which hard to identify and reproduce. </b>

<p><br><b></p>
<p>The main idea behind serverless computing is that you don’t need to manage the creation and configuration of server. All you need to focus on is splitting your app into multiple functions which will be triggered by some actions.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serverless Computing is still using servers. So saying there are no servers in serverless computing is completely wrong</li>
<li>Serverless Computing allows you to have a different paying model. You basically pay only when your functions are running and not when the VM or containers are running as in other payment models </b>

Explain subnet mask and given an example
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A Subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address, and divides the IP address into network address and host address. Subnet Mask is made by setting network bits to all “1”s and setting host bits to all “0”s. Within a given network, two host addresses are reserved for special purpose, and cannot be assigned to hosts. The “0” address is assigned a network address and “255” is assigned to a broadcast address, and they cannot be assigned to hosts.</p>
<p><strong>For Example</strong></p>
<pre><code>| Address Class | No of Network Bits | No of Host Bits | Subnet mask     | CIDR notation |

<p><br><b></p>
<p>A router is a physical or virtual appliance that passes information between two or more packet-switched computer networks.

What is a proxy? How does it works? What do we need it for?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse.</p>
<p>If you’re using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you.</p>
<p>roxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy.</p>

What is TCP? How does it works? What is the 3 way handshake?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>TCP 3-way handshake or three-way handshake is a process which is used in a TCP/IP network to make a connection between server and client.</p>
<p>A three-way handshake is primarily used to create a TCP socket connection. It works when:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client node sends a SYN data packet over an IP network to a server on the same or an external network. The objective of this packet is to ask/infer if the server is open for new connections.</li>
<li>The target server must have open ports that can accept and initiate new connections. When the server receives the SYN packet from the client node, it responds and returns a confirmation receipt – the ACK packet or SYN/ACK packet.</li>
<li>The client node receives the SYN/ACK from the server and responds with an ACK packet. </b>

What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>TCP establishes a connection between the client and the server to guarantee the order of the packages, on the other hand, UDP does not establish a connection between client and server and doesn’t handle package order. This makes UDP more lightweight than TCP and a perfect candidate for services like streaming.</p>

What is ARP? How does it works?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. When you try to ping an IP address on your local network, say 192.168.1.1, your system has to turn the IP address 192.168.1.1 into a MAC address. This involves using ARP to resolve the address, hence its name.</p>
Systems keep an ARP look-up table where they store information about what IP addresses are associated with what MAC addresses. When trying to send a packet to an IP address, the system will first consult this table to see if it already knows the MAC address. If there is a value cached, ARP is not used. </b>

<ul>
<li>A host upon entering a network, broadcasts a message in search of a DHCP server (DHCP DISCOVER)</li>
<li>An offer message is sent back by the DHCP server as a packet containing lease time, subnet mask, IP addresses, etc (DHCP OFFER)</li>
<li>Depending on which offer accepted, the client sends back a reply broadcast letting all DHCP servers know (DHCP REQUEST)</li>
<li>Server sends an acknowledgment (DHCP ACK)</li>

Running the command <code>df</code> you get “command not found”. What could be wrong and how to fix it?
</summary>
<br><b> </b>
<p>
<p><b> Most likely the default/generated $PATH was somehow modified or overridden thus not containing <code>/bin/</code> where df would normally go. This issue could also happen if bash_profile or any configuration file of your interpreter was wrongly modified, causing erratics behaviours. You would solve this by fixing your $PATH variable:</p>
<p>As to fix it there are several options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Manually adding what you need to your <span class="math inline">\(PATH &lt;code&gt;PATH=&quot;\)</span>PATH":/user/bin:/..etc</code></li>
<li>You have your weird env variables backed up.</li>
<li>You would look for your distro default $PATH variable, copy paste using method #1</li>
</ol>
Note: There are many ways of getting errors like this: if bash_profile or any configuration file of your interpreter was wrongly modified; causing erratics behaviours, permissions issues, bad compiled software (if you compiled it by yourself)… there is no answer that will be true 100% of the time. </b>

One reason it happens is when a parent process is programmed incorrectly. Every parent process should execute wait() to get the exit code from the child process which finished to run.

<p><br><b></p>
<p>You can’t kill a zombie process the regular way with <code>kill -9</code> for example as it’s already dead.</p>
<p>One way to kill zombie process is by sending SIGCHLD to the parent process telling it to terminate its child processes. This might not work if the parent process wasn’t programmed properly. The invocation is <code>kill -s SIGCHLD [parent_pid]</code></p>
You can also try closing/terminating the parent process. This will make the zombie process a child of init (1) which does periodic cleanups and will at some point clean up the zombie process. </b>

<summary>
If you had to design an API for processes in an operating system, what would this API look like?
</summary>

<li>Delete - allow to remove/destroy processes</li>
<li>State - allow to check the state of the process, whether it’s running, stopped, waiting, etc.</li>
<li>Stop - allow to stop a running process </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
How a process is created?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>The OS is reading program’s code and any additional relevant data</li>
<li>Program’s bytes are loaded into the memory or more specifically, into the address space of the process.</li>
<li>Memory is allocated for program’s stack (aka run-time stack). The stack also initialized by the OS with data like argv, argc and parameters to main()</li>
<li>Memory is allocated for program’s heap which is required for data structures like linked lists and hash tables</li>
<li>I/O initialization tasks like in Unix/Linux based systems where each process has 3 file descriptors (input, output and error)</li>
<li>OS is running the program, strarting from main()</li>
</ul>
Note: The loading of the program’s code into the memory done lazily which means the OS loads only partial relevant pieces required for the process to run and not the entire code. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
True or False? The loading of the program into the memory is done eagerly (all at once)
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
False. It was true in the past but today’s operating systems perform lazy loading which means only the relevant pieces required for the process to run are loaded first. </b>
</details>

</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Running - it’s executing instructions</li>

What is “time sharing”?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Even when using a system with one physical CPU, it’s possible to allow multiple users to work on it and run programs. This is possible with time sharing where computing resources are shared in a way it seems to the user the system has multiple CPUs but in fact it’s simply one CPU shared by applying multiprogramming and multi-tasking. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is “space sharing”?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Somewhat the opposite of time sharing. While in time sharing a resource is used for a while by one entity and then the same resource can be used by another resource, in space sharing the space is shared by multiple entities but in a way it’s not being transfered between them.<br> It’s used by one entity until this entity decides to get rid of it. Take for example storage. In storage, a file is your until you decide to delete it. </b>

<summary>
<p>Describe each of the following components in Ansible, including the relationship between them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task</li>
<li>Module</li>
<li>Play</li>
<li>Playbook</li>
<li>Role
</summary>
<br><b></li>
</ul>
<p>Task – a call to a specific Ansible module Module – the actual unit of code executed by Ansible on your own host or a remote host. Modules are indexed by category (database, file, network, …) and also referred to as task plugins.</p>
<p>Play – One or more tasks executed on a given host(s)</p>
<p>Playbook – One or more plays. Each play can be executed on the same or different hosts</p>
Role – Ansible roles allows you to group resources based on certain functionality/service such that they can be easily reused. In a role, you have directories for variables, defaults, files, templates, handlers, tasks, and metadata. You can then use the role by simply specifying it in your playbook. </b>

How Ansible is different from other Automation tools?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Ansible is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agentless</li>
<li>Minimal run requirements (Python &amp; SSH) and simple to use</li>
<li>Default mode is “push” (it supports also pull)</li>
<li>Focus on simpleness and ease-of-use </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What kind of automation you wouldn’t do with Ansible and why?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
While it’s possible to provision resources with Ansible it might not be the best choice for doing so as Ansible doesn’t save state by default. So a task that creates 5 instances for example, when executed again will create additional 5 instances (unless additional check is implemented). </b>

What is an inventory file and how do you define one?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>An inventory file defines hosts and/or groups of hosts on which Ansible tasks executed upon.</p>

What is a dynamic inventory file? When you would use one?
</summary>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>A dynamic inventory file tracks hosts from one or more sources like cloud providers and CMDB systems.</p>
You should use one when using external sources and especially when the hosts in your environment are being automatically<br> spun up and shut down, without you tracking every change in these sources. </b>

Explain the Diffrence between Forks and Serial &amp; Throttle.
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p><code>Serial</code> is like running the playbook for each host in turn, waiting for completion of the complete playbook before moving on to the next host. <code>forks</code>=1 means run the first task in a play on one host before running the same task on the next host, so the first task will be run for each host before the next task is touched. Default fork is 5 in ansible.</p>
<pre><code>[defaults]
forks = 30</code></pre>
<pre><code>- hosts: webservers
  serial: 1
  tasks:
    - name: ...</code></pre>
<p>Ansible also supports <code>throttle</code> This keyword limits the number of workers up to the maximum set via the forks setting or serial. This can be useful in restricting tasks that may be CPU-intensive or interact with a rate-limiting API</p>

- command: /path/to/cpu_intensive_command

Why Terraform and not other technologies? (e.g. Ansible, Puppet, CloufFormation)
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A common <em>wrong</em> answer is to say that Ansible and Puppet are configuration management tools and Terraform is a provisioning tool. While technically true, it doesn’t mean Ansible and Puppet can’t be used for provisioning infrastructure. Also, it doesn’t explain why Terraform should be used over CloudFormation if at all.</p>
<p>The benefits of Terraform over the other tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>It follows the immutable infrastructure approach which has benefits like avoiding a configuration drift over time</li>
<li>Ansible and Puppet are more procedural (you mention what to execute in each step) and Terraform is declarative since you describe the overall desired state and not per resource or task. You can give the example of going from 1 to 2 servers in each tool. In Terraform you specify 2, in Ansible and puppet you have to only provision 1 additional server so you need to explicitly make sure you provision only another one server. </b>

</ul>
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<code>terraform init</code> scans your code to figure which providers are you using and download them. <code>terraform plan</code> will let you see what terraform is about to do before actually doing it. <code>terraform validate</code> checks if configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent within a directory. <code>terraform apply</code> will provision the resources specified in the .tf files. </b>

</details>
<details>
<summary>
What <code>terraform taint</code> does?
</summary>
<br><b> <code>terraform taint resource.id</code> manually marks the resource as tainted in the state file. So when you run <code>terraform apply</code> the next time, the resource will be destroyed and recreated. </b>

<summary>
What is a data source? In what scenarios for example would need to use it?
</summary>
<p><br><b> Data sources lookup or compute values that can be used elsewhere in terraform configuration.</p>
There are quite a few cases you might need to use them: * you want to reference resources not managed through terraform * you want to reference resources managed by a different terraform module * you want to cleanly compute a value with typechecking, such as with <code>aws_iam_policy_document</code> </b>
</details>
<details>

<br><b> Terraform generates a <code>terraform.tfstate</code> json file that describes components/service provisioned on the specified provider. Remote State stores this file in a remote storage media to enable collaboration amongst team. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Explain “State Locking”
</summary>
<br><b> State locking is a mechanism that blocks an operations against a specific state file from multiple callers so as to avoid conflicting operations from different team members. Once the first caller’s operation’s lock is released the other team member may go ahead to carryout his own operation. Nevertheless Terraform will first check the state file to see if the desired resource already exist and if not it goes ahead to create it. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is the “Random” provider? What is it used for
</summary>
<br><b> The random provider aids in generating numeric or alphabetic characters to use as a prefix or suffix for a desired named identifier. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How do you test a terraform module?
</summary>
<br><b> Many examples are acceptable, but the most common answer would likely to be using the tool <code>terratest</code>, and to test that a module can be initialized, can create resources, and can destroy those resources cleanly. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Aside from <code>.tfvars</code> files or CLI arguments, how can you inject dependencies from other modules?
</summary>
<br><b> The built-in terraform way would be to use <code>remote-state</code> to lookup the outputs from other modules. It is also common in the community to use a tool called <code>terragrunt</code> to explicitly inject variables between modules. </b>

How are containers different from virtual machines (VMs)?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>The primary difference between containers and VMs is that containers allow you to virtualize multiple workloads on the operating system while in the case of VMs the hardware is being virtualized to run multiple machines each with its own OS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Containers don’t require an entire guest operating system as VMs</li>
<li>It usually takes a few seconds to set up a container as opposed to VMs which can take minutes or at least more time than containers as there is an entire OS to boot and initialize as opposed to container where you mainly lunch the app itself</li>
<li>Containers are isolated from each other, but not as concretely as virtual machines. It is possible for a malicious user to break into the host OS from a container and vice versa. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
In which scenarios would you use containers and in which you would prefer to use VMs?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>You should choose VMs when: * you need run an application which requires all the resources and functionalities of an OS * you need full isolation and security</p>

<p>(docker-)containerd - Also a daemon, listening on a Unix socket, exposes gRPC endpoints. Handles all the low-level container management tasks, storage, image distribution, network attachment, etc…</p>
<p>(docker-)containerd-ctr - A lightweight CLI to directly communicate with containerd. Think of it as how ‘docker’ is to ‘dockerd’.</p>
<p>(docker-)runc - A lightweight binary for actually running containers. Deals with the low-level interfacing with Linux capabilities like cgroups, namespaces, etc…</p>
<p>(docker-)containerd-shim - After runC actually runs the container, it exits (allowing us to not have any long-running processes responsible for our containers). The shim is the component which sits between containerd and runc to facilitate this.</p>

Describe difference between cgroups and namespaces
</summary>
<p><br><b> cgroup: Control Groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets of tasks, and all their future children, into hierarchical groups with specialized behaviour. namespace: wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<p>Cgroups = limits how much you can use; namespaces = limits what you can see (and therefore use)</p>
<p>Cgroups involve resource metering and limiting: memory CPU block I/O network</p>
<p>Namespaces provide processes with their own view of the system</p>
<p>Multiple namespaces: pid,net, mnt, uts, ipc, user</p>

<h5 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h5>
<details>
<summary>
What is Dockerfile
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is the difference between ADD and COPY in Dockerfile?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
COPY takes in a src and destination. It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself. ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination. Although ADD and COPY are functionally similar, generally speaking, COPY is preferred. That’s because it’s more transparent than ADD. COPY only supports the basic copying of local files into the container, while ADD has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support) that are not immediately obvious. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is the difference between CMD and RUN in Dockerfile?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
RUN lets you execute commands inside of your Docker image. These commands get executed once at build time and get written into your Docker image as a new layer. CMD is the command the container executes by default when you launch the built image. A Dockerfile can only have one CMD. You could say that CMD is a Docker run-time operation, meaning it’s not something that gets executed at build time. It happens when you run an image. A running image is called a container. </b>
</details>

Explain what is Docker compose and what is it used for
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.</p>
For example, you can use it to set up ELK stack where the services are: elasticsearch, logstash and kibana. Each running in its own container. </b>

<p><br><b></p>
<p>Docker Hub is a native Docker registry service which allows you to run pull and push commands to install and deploy Docker images from the Docker Hub.</p>
Docker Cloud is built on top of the Docker Hub so Docker Cloud provides you with more options/features compared to Docker Hub. One example is Swarm management which means you can create new swarms in Docker Cloud. </b>

Explain image layers
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
A Docker image is built up from a series of layers. Each layer represents an instruction in the image’s Dockerfile. Each layer except the very last one is read-only. Each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it. The layers are stacked on top of each other. When you create a new container, you add a new writable layer on top of the underlying layers. This layer is often called the “container layer”. All changes made to the running container, such as writing new files, modifying existing files, and deleting files, are written to this thin writable container layer. The major difference between a container and an image is the top writable layer. All writes to the container that add new or modify existing data are stored in this writable layer. When the container is deleted, the writable layer is also deleted. The underlying image remains unchanged. Because each container has its own writable container layer, and all changes are stored in this container layer, multiple containers can share access to the same underlying image and yet have their own data state. </b>

<p>To understand what Kubernetes is good for, let’s look at some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You would like to run a certain application in a container on multiple different locations. Sure, if it’s 2-3 servers/locations, you can do it by yourself but it can be challenging to scale it up to additional multiple location.<br></li>
<li>Performing updates and changes across hundreds of containers<br></li>

</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>SOLID design principles are about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it easier to extend the functionality of the system</li>
<li>Make the code more readable and easier to maintain</li>
</ul>
<p>SOLID is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Responsibility - A class should only have a single responsibility</li>
<li>Open-Closed - An entity should be open for extension, but closed for modification. What this practically means is that you should extend functionality by adding a new code and not by modifying it. Your system should be separated into components so it can be easily extended without breaking everything.</li>
<li>Liskov Substitution - Any derived class should be able to substitute the its parent without altering its corrections. Practically, every part of the code will get the expected result no matter which part is using it</li>
<li>Interface segregation - A client should never depend on anything it doesn’t uses</li>
<li>Dependency Inversion - High level modules should depend on abstractions, not low level modules </b>

<p>It’s a search algorithm used with sorted arrays/lists to find a target value by dividing the array each iteration and comparing the middle value to the target value.

This continues until the value is found (or the array divided max times)</p>

What are some characteristics of the Python programming language?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<pre><code>1. It is a high level general purpose programming language created in 1991 by Guido Van Rosum.
2. The language is interpreted, being the CPython (Written in C) the most used/maintained implementation.
3. It is strongly typed. The typing discipline is duck typing and gradual.
4. Python focuses on readability and makes use of whitespaces/identation instead of brackets { }
5. The python package manager is called PIP &quot;pip installs packages&quot;, having more than 200.000 available packages.
6. Python comes with pip installed and a big standard library that offers the programmer many precooked solutions.
7. In python **Everything** is an object.

There are many other characteristics but these are the main ones that every python programmer should know.</code></pre>

What is mutability? Which of the built-in types in Python are mutable? How can you show that a certain data type is mutable?

<p><br><b></p>
<p>Mutability determines whether you can modify an object of specific type.</p>
<p>The mutable data types are:</p>
<pre><code>List
Dictionary
Set</code></pre>
<p>The immutable data types are:</p>
<pre><code>Numbers (int, float, ...)
String
Bool
Tuple
Frozenset</code></pre>
You can usually use the function hash() to check an object mutability. If an object is hashable, it is immutable (although this does not always work as intended as user defined objects might be mutable and hashable). </b>

Explain inheritance and how to use it in Python
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<pre><code>By definition inheritance is the mechanism where an object acts as a base of another object, retaining all its
properties.

So if Class B inherits from Class A, every characteristics from class A will be also available in class B.
Class A would be the &#39;Base class&#39; and B class would be the &#39;derived class&#39;.

This comes handy when you have several classes that share the same functionalities.

The basic syntax is:

class Base: pass

class Derived(Base): pass

A more forged example:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self):
        print(&quot;and I&#39;m alive!&quot;)

    def eat(self, food):
        print(&quot;ñom ñom ñom&quot;, food)

class Human(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print(&#39;My name is &#39;, name)
        super().__init__()

    def write_poem(self):
        print(&#39;Foo bar bar foo foo bar!&#39;)

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print(&#39;My name is&#39;, name)
        super().__init__()

    def bark(self):
        print(&#39;woof woof&#39;)


michael = Human(&#39;Michael&#39;)
michael.eat(&#39;Spam&#39;)
michael.write_poem()

bruno = Dog(&#39;Bruno&#39;)
bruno.eat(&#39;bone&#39;)
bruno.bark()

&gt;&gt;&gt; My name is  Michael
&gt;&gt;&gt; and I&#39;m alive!
&gt;&gt;&gt; ñom ñom ñom Spam
&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo bar bar foo foo bar!
&gt;&gt;&gt; My name is Bruno
&gt;&gt;&gt; and I&#39;m alive!
&gt;&gt;&gt; ñom ñom ñom bone
&gt;&gt;&gt; woof woof

Calling super() calls the Base method, thus, calling super().__init__() we called the Animal __init__.

There is a more advanced python feature called MetaClasses that aid the programmer to directly control class creation.</code></pre>

What is an error? What is an exception? What types of exceptions are you familiar with?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<pre><code>#  Note that you generally don&#39;t need to know the compiling process but knowing where everything comes from
#  and giving complete answers shows that you truly know what you are talking about.

Generally, every compiling process have a two steps.
    - Analysis
    - Code Generation.

    Analysis can be broken into:
        1. Lexical analysis   (Tokenizes source code)
        2. Syntactic analysis (Check whether the tokens are legal or not, tldr, if syntax is correct)

               for i in &#39;foo&#39;
                          ^
             SyntaxError: invalid syntax

        We missed &#39;:&#39;


        3. Semantic analysis  (Contextual analysis, legal syntax can still trigger errors, did you try to divide by 0,
          hash a mutable object or use an undeclared function?)

                 1/0
                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

    These three analysis steps are the responsible for error handlings.

    The second step would be responsible for errors, mostly syntax errors, the most common error.
    The third step would be responsible for Exceptions.

    As we have seen, Exceptions are semantic errors, there are many builtin Exceptions:

        ImportError
        ValueError
        KeyError
        FileNotFoundError
        IndentationError
        IndexError
        ...

    You can also have user defined Exceptions that have to inherit from the `Exception` class, directly or indirectly.

    Basic example:

    class DividedBy2Error(Exception):
        def __init__(self, message):
            self.message = message


    def division(dividend,divisor):
        if divisor == 2:
            raise DividedBy2Error(&#39;I dont want you to divide by 2!&#39;)
        return dividend / divisor

    division(100, 2)

    &gt;&gt;&gt; __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!</code></pre>

Explain Exception Handling and how to use it in Python
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Errors detected during execution are called Exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>Handling Exception:</strong> When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.</br> Exceptions can be handled using <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> statement in python.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Following example asks the user for input until a valid integer has been entered. </br> If user enter a non-integer value it will raise exception and using except it will catch that exception and ask the user to enter valid integer again.</p>

<p>There are many ways of solving this problem:<br> <code># Note: :list and -&gt; bool are just python typings, they are not needed for the correct execution of the algorithm. </code></p>

<pre><code>def is_unique(l:list) -&gt; bool:

Explain what is a decorator
</summary>
<p><br><b> </b> <b>In python, everything is an object, even functions themselves. Therefore you could pass functions as arguments for another function eg;</p>
<pre><code>def wee(word):
    return word

def oh(f):
    return f + &quot;Ohh&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; oh(wee(&quot;Wee&quot;))
&lt;&lt;&lt; Wee Ohh</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to control the before execution of any given function and if we added another function as wrapper, (a function receiving another function that receives a function as parameter) we could also control the after execution.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to control the before-after execution of many functions and it would get tedious to write</p>
<p><code> f = function(function_1())</code> <code> f = function(function_1(function_2(*args)))</code></p>
every time, that’s what decorators do, they introduce syntax to write all of this on the go, using the keyword ‘@’. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Can you show how to write and use decorators?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p><code> These two decorators (ntimes and timer) are usually used to display decorators functionalities, you can find them in lots of tutorials/reviews. I first saw these examples two years ago in pyData 2017. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lmCu8wz8ro&amp;t=3731s</code></p>
<pre><code>Simple decorator:

def deco(f):
    print(f&quot;Hi I am the {f.__name__}() function!&quot;)
    return f

@deco
def hello_world():
    return &quot;Hi, I&#39;m in!&quot;

a = hello_world()
print(a)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi I am the hello_world() function!
    Hi, I&#39;m in!</code></pre>
<p>This is the simplest decorator version, it basically saves us from writting <code>a = deco(hello_world())</code>. But at this point we can only control the before execution, let’s take on the after:</p>
<pre><code>def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(&quot;Rick Sanchez!&quot;)
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        print(&quot;I&#39;m in!&quot;)
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f(word):
    print(word)

a = f(&quot;************&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rick Sanchez!
    ************
    I&#39;m in!</code></pre>
<p>deco receives a function -&gt; f wrapper receives the arguments -&gt; *args, **kwargs</p>
<p>wrapper returns the function plus the arguments -&gt; f(*args, **kwargs) deco returns wrapper.</p>
<p>As you can see we conveniently do things before and after the execution of a given function.</p>
<p>For example, we could write a decorator that calculates the execution time of a function.</p>
<pre><code>import time
def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        before = time.time()
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        after = time.time()
        print(after-before)
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f():
    time.sleep(2)
    print(&quot;************&quot;)

a = f()
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.0008859634399414</code></pre>
<p>Or create a decorator that executes a function n times.</p>
<pre><code>def n_times(n):
    def wrapper(f):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(n):
                func = f(*args, **kwargs)
            return func
        return inner
    return wrapper

@n_times(4)
def f():
    print(&quot;************&quot;)

a = f()

Explain the following: <code>git directory</code>, <code>working directory</code> and <code>staging area</code>
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>The Git directory is where Git stores the meta data and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.</p>
<p>The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.</p>
<p>The staging area is a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the index, but it’s becoming standard to refer to it as the staging area.</p>

What this line in scripts mean?: <code>#!/bin/bash</code>
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p><code>#!/bin/bash</code> is She-bang</p>
<p>/bin/bash is the most common shell used as default shell for user login of the linux system. The shell’s name is an acronym for Bourne-again shell. Bash can execute the vast majority of scripts and thus is widely used because it has more features, is well developed and better syntax.</p>

</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Few example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments on how to run it and/or what it does</li>
<li>Adding “set -e” since I want the script to exit if a certain command failed</li>
</ul>
You can have an entirely different answer. It’s based only on your experience. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
True or False?: when a certain command/line fails, the script, by default, will exit and will no keep running
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Depends on the language and settings used. When a script written in Bash fails to run a certain command it will keep running and will execute all other commands mentioned after the command which failed. Most of the time we would actually want the opposite to happen. In order to make Bash exist when a specific command fails, use ‘set -e’ in your script. </b>

How do you debug shell scripts?

What does SQL stand for?

<p><br><b></p>
<p>Structured Query Language</p>
</b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How is SQL Different from NoSQL
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What does it mean when a database is ACID compliant?
</summary>
<p><br></p>
<p>ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. In order to be ACID compliant, the database much meet each of the four criteria</p>
<p><strong>Atomicity</strong> - When a change occurs to the database, it should either succeed or fail as a whole.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to update a table, the update should completely execute. If it only partially executes, the update is considered failed as a whole, and will not go through - the DB will revert back to it’s original state before the update occurred. It should also be mentioned that Atomicity ensures that each transaction is completed as it’s own stand alone “unit” - if any part fails, the whole statement fails.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong> - any change made to the database should bring it from one valid state into the next.</p>
<p>For example, if you make a change to the DB, it shouldn’t corrupt it. Consistency is upheld by checks and constraints that are pre-defined in the DB. For example, if you tried to change a value from a string to an int when the column should be of datatype string, a consistent DB would not allow this transaction to go through, and the action would not be executed</p>
<p><strong>Isolation</strong> - this ensures that a database will never be seen “mid-update” - as multiple transactions are running at the same time, it should still leave the DB in the same state as if the transactions were being run sequentially.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that 20 other people were making changes to the database at the same time. At the time you executed your query, 15 of the 20 changes had gone through, but 5 were still in progress. You should only see the 15 changes that had completed - you wouldn’t see the database mid-update as the change goes through.</p>
<p><strong>Durability</strong> - Once a change is committed, it will remain committed regardless of what happens (power failure, system crash, etc.). This means that all completed transactions must be recorded in non-volatile memory.</p>
Note that SQL is by nature ACID compliant. Certain NoSQL DB’s can be ACID compliant depending on how they operate, but as a general rule of thumb, NoSQL DB’s are not considered ACID compliant
</details>
<details>
<summary>
When is it best to use SQL? NoSQL?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>SQL - Best used when data integrity is crucial. SQL is typically implemented with many businesses and areas within the finance field due to it’s ACID compliance.</p>
<p>NoSQL - Great if you need to scale things quickly. NoSQL was designed with web applications in mind, so it works great if you need to quickly spread the same information around to multiple servers</p>
Additionally, since NoSQL does not adhere to the strict table with columns and rows structure that Relational Databases require, you can store different data types together. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a Cartesian Product?
</summary>
<p><br></p>
<p>A Cartesian product is when all rows from the first table are joined to all rows in the second table. This can be done implicitly by not defining a key to join, or explicitly by calling a CROSS JOIN on two tables, such as below:</p>
<p>Select * from customers <strong>CROSS JOIN</strong> orders;</p>
Note that a Cartesian product can also be a bad thing - when performing a join on two tables in which both do not have unique keys, this could cause the returned information to be incorrect.

<p>Although this was a simple statement, the “with” clause really shines when a complex query needs to be run on a table before joining to another. With statements are nice, because you create a pseudo temp when running your query, instead of creating a whole new table.</p>

<summary>
List and explain the enterprise security capabilities provided by Anthos
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Control plane security - GCP manages and maintains the K8s control plane out of the box. The user can secure the api-server by using master authorized networks and private clusters. These allow the user to disable access on the public IP address by assigning a private IP address to the master.</li>
<li>Node security - By default workloads are provisioned on Compute engine instances that use Google’s Container Optimised OS. This operating system implements a locked-down firewall, limited user accounts with root disabled and a read-only filesystem. There is a further option to enable GKE Sandbox for stronger isolation in multi-tenant deployment scenarios.</li>
<li>Network security - Within a created cluster VPC, Anthos GKE leverages a powerful software-defined network that enables simple Pod-to-Pod communications. Network policies allow locking down ingress and egress connections in a given namespace. Filtering can also be implemented to incoming load-balanced traffic for services that require external access, by supplying whitelisted CIDR IP ranges.</li>
<li>Workload security - Running workloads run with limited privileges, default Docker AppArmor security policies are applied to all Kubernetes Pods. Workload identity for Anthos GKE aligns with the open source kubernetes service accounts with GCP service account permissions.</li>
<li>Audit logging - Adminstrators are given a way to retain, query, process and alert on events of the deployed environments. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
How can workloads deployed on Anthos GKE on-prem clusters securely connect to Google Cloud services?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Google Cloud Virtual Private Network (Cloud VPN) - this is for secure networking</li>
<li>Google Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) - for key management </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What is Island Mode configuration with regards to networking in Anthos GKE deployed on-prem?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>This is when pods can directly talk to each other within a cluster, but cannot be reached from outside the cluster thus forming an “island” within the network that is not connected to the external network. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
Explain Anthos Config Management
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>It is a core component of the Anthos stack which provides platform, service and security operators with a single, unified approach to multi-cluster management that spans both on-premises and cloud environments. It closely follows K8s best practices, favoring declarative approaches over imperative operations, and actively monitors cluster state and applies the desired state as defined in Git. It includes three key components as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An importer that reads from a central Git repository</li>
<li>A component that synchronises stored configuration data into K8s objects</li>
<li>A component that monitors drift between desired and actual cluster configurations with a capability of reconciliation when need rises. </b>
</details></li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
How does Anthos Config Management help?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
It follows common modern software development practices which makes cluster configuration, management and policy changes auditable, revertable, and versionable easily enforcing IT governance and unifying resource management in an organisation. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is Anthos Service Mesh?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a suite of tools that assist in monitoring and managing deployed services on Anthos of all shapes and sizes whether running in cloud, hybrid or multi-cloud environments. It leverages the APIs and core components from Istio, a highly configurable and open-source service mesh platform. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
Describe the two main components of Anthos Service Mesh
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Data plane - it consists of a set of distributed proxies that mediate all inbound and outbound network traffic between individual services which are configured using a centralised control plane and an open API</li>
<li>Control plane - is a fully managed offering outside of Anthos GKE clusters to simplify management overhead and ensure highest possible availability. </b>
</details></li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
What are the components of the managed control plane of Anthos Service Mesh?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Traffic Director - it is GCP’s fully managed service mesh traffic control plane, responsible for translating Istio API objects into configuration information for the distributed proxies, as well as directing service mesh ingress and egress traffic</li>
<li>Managed CA - is a centralised certificate authority responsible for providing SSL certificates to each of the distributed proxies, authentication information and distributing secrets</li>
<li>Operations tooling - formerly stackdriver, provides a managed ingestion point for observability and telemetry, specifically monitoring, tracing and logging data generated by each of the proxies. This powers the observability dashboard for operators to visually inspect their services and service dependencies assisting in the implementation of SRE best practices for monitoring SLIs and establishing SLOs. </b>
</details></li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
How does Anthos Service Mesh help?
</summary>
<p><br><b> Tool and technology integration that makes up Anthos service mesh delivers signficant operational benefits to Anthos environments, with minimal additional overhead such as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform observability - the data plane reports service to service communication back to the control plane generating a service dependency graph. Traffic inspection by the proxy inserts headers to facilitate distributed tracing, capturing and reporting service logs together with service-level metrics (i.e latency, errors, availability).</li>
<li>Operational agility - fine-grained controls for managing the flow of inter-mesh (north-south) and intra-mesh (east-west) traffic are provided.</li>
<li>Policy-driven security - policies can be enforced consistently across diverse protocols and runtimes as service communications are secured by default. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
List possible use cases of traffic controls that can be implemented within Anthos Service Mesh
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic splitting across differing service versions for canary or A/B testing</li>
<li>Circuit breaking to prevent cascading failures</li>
<li>Fault injection to help build resilient and fault-tolerant deployments</li>
<li>HTTP header-based traffic steering between individual services or versions </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What is Cloud Run for Anthos?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
It is part of the Anthos stack that brings a serverless container experience to Anthos, offering a high-level platform experience on top of K8s clusters. It is built with Knative, an open-source operator for K8s that brings serverless application serving and eventing capabilities. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How does Cloud Run for Anthos simplify operations?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Platform teams in organisations that wish to offer developers additional tools to test, deploy and run applications can use Knative to enhance this experience on Anthos as Cloud Run. Below are some of the benefits;</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy migration from K8s deployments - Without Cloud Run, platform engineers have to configure deployment, service, and HorizontalPodAutoscalers(HPA) objects to a loadbalancer and autoscaling. If application is already serving traffic it becomes hard to change configurations or roll back efficiently. Using Cloud Run all this is managed thus the Knative service manifest describes the application to be autoscaled and loadbalanced</li>
<li>Autoscaling - a sudden traffic spike may cause application containers in K8s to crash due to overload thus an efficient automated autoscaling is executed to serve the high volume of traffic</li>
<li>Networking - it has built-in load balancing capabilities and policies for traffic splitting between multiple versions of an application.</li>
<li>Releases and rollouts - supports the notion of the Knatibe API’s revisions which describe new versions or different configurations of your application and canary deployments by splitting traffic.</li>
<li>Monitoring - observing and recording metrics such as latency, error rate and requests per second. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
List and explain three high-level out of the box autoscaling primitives offered by Cloud Run for Anthos that do not exist in K8s natively
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Rapid, request-based autoscaling - default autoscalers monitor request metrics which allows Cloud Run for Anthos to handle spiky traffic patterns smoothly</li>
<li>Concurrency controls - limits such as max in-flight requests per container are enforced to ensure the container does not become overloaded and crash. More containers are added to handle the spiky traffic, buffering the requests.</li>
<li>Scale to zero - if an application is inactive for a while Cloud Run scales it down to zero to reduce its footprint. Alternatively one can turn off scale-to-zero to prevent cold starts. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
List some Cloud Run for Anthos use cases
</summary>
<p><br><b> As it does not support stateful applications or sticky sessions, it is suitable for running stateless applications such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning model predictions e.g Tensorflow serving containers</li>
<li>API gateways, API middleware, web front ends and Microservices</li>
<li>Event handlers, ETL </b>

<p>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is an type of a attack when the attacker inserts browser executable code within a HTTP response. Now the injected attack is not stored in the web application, it will only affact the users who open the maliciously crafted link or third-party web page. A successful attack allows the attacker to access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site </p>
<p>You can test by detecting user-defined variables and how to input them. This includes hidden or non-obvious inputs such as HTTP parameters, POST data, hidden form field values, and predefined radio or selection values. You then analyze each found vector to see if their are potential vulnerabilities, then when found you craft input data with each input vector. Then you test the crafted input and see if it works.</p>

</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>From the official docs:</p>
“Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps.” </b>

How data is stored in elasticsearch?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is stored in an index</li>
<li>The index is spread across the cluster using shards </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What is an Index?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Index in Elastic is in most cases compared to a whole database from the SQL/NoSQL world.<br> You can choose to have one index to hold all the data of your app or have multiple indices where each index holds different type of your app (e.g. index for each service your app is running).</p>
<p>The official docs also offer a great explanation (in general, it’s really good documentation, as every project should have):</p>
“An index can be thought of as an optimized collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields, which are the key-value pairs that contain your data” </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Explain Shards
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
An index is split into shards and documents are hashed to a particular shard. Each shard may be on a different node in a cluster and each one of the shards is a self contained index.<br> This allows Elasticsearch to scale to an entire cluster of servers. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is an Inverted Index?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>From the official docs:</p>
“An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in.” </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a Document?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Continuing with the comparison to SQL/NoSQL a Document in Elastic is a row in table in the case of SQL or a document in a collection in the case of NoSQL. As in NoSQL a Document is a JSON object which holds data on a unit in your app. What is this unit depends on the your app. If your app related to book then each document describes a book. If you are app is about shirts then each document is a shirt. </b>

<summary>
True or False? Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has the same data structure for unified and quick query ability
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>

<li>You can perform language-specific analysis </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
Explain Replicas
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
In a network/cloud environment where failures can be expected any time, it is very useful and highly recommended to have a failover mechanism in case a shard/node somehow goes offline or disappears for whatever reason. To this end, Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards into what are called replica shards, or replicas for short. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Can you explain Term Frequency &amp; Document Frequency?

<summary>
What is DNS? What is it used for?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
DNS (Domain Name Systems) is a protocol used for converting domain names into IP addresses.<br> As you know computer networking is done with IP addresses (layer 3 of the OSI model) but for as humans it’s hard to remember IP addresses, it’s much easier to remember names. This why we need something such as DNS to convert any domain name we type into an IP address. You can think on DNS as a huge phonebook or database where each corresponding name has an IP. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How DNS works?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>In general the process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user types an address in the web browser (some_site.com)</li>
<li>The operating system gets a request from the browser to translate the address the user entered</li>
<li>A query created to check a local entry of the address exists in the system. In case it doesn’t, the request is forwarded to the DNS resolver</li>
<li>The Resolver is a server, usually configured by your ISP when you connect to the internet, that responsible for resolving your query by contacting other DNS servers</li>
<li>The Resolver contacts the root nameserver (aka as .)</li>
<li>The root nameserver responds with the address of the relevant Top Level Domain DNS server (if your address ends with org then the org TLD)</li>
<li>The Resolver then contacts the TLD DNS and TLD DNS responds with the IP address that matches the address the user typed in the browser</li>
<li>The Resolver passes this information to the browser</li>
<li>The user is happy :D </b>
</details></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A</li>

<li>MX</li>
<li>AAAA </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What is a A record?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
A (Address) Maps a host name to an IP address. When a computer has multiple adapter cards and IP addresses, it should have multiple address records. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a AAAA record?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
An AAAA Record performs the same function as an A Record, but for an IPv6 Address. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a PTR record?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
While an A record points a domain name to an IP address, a PTR record does the opposite and resolves the IP address to a domain name. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a MX record?
</summary>
<br><b> MX (Mail Exchange) Specifies a mail exchange server for the domain, which allows mail to be delivered to the correct mail servers in the domain. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Is DNS using TCP or UDP?

<ul>
<li>Availability: Every request receives a response (it doesn’t has to be the most recent data)</li>
<li>Consistency: Every request receives a response with the latest/most recent data</li>

</details>
<details>
<summary>
What are the disadvantages of Vertical Scaling?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>

</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>The load on the producers or consumers may be high which will then cause them to hang or crash.<br> Instead of working in “push mode”, the consumers can pull tasks only when they are ready to handle them. It can be fixed by using a streaming platform like Kafka, Kinesis, etc. This platform will make sure to handle the high load/traffic and pass tasks/messages to consumers only when the ready to get them.</p>
